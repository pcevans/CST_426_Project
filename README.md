# CST_426_Project
TODO:
1) Fix path crossing: possibly pixel areas w/ height add every time area is crossed
2) Process all audio data at once: a) get audioclip data and do Fourier transformation manually? or b) figure out how to correctly (and quickly) fast-forward an AudioSource to get all auto-FFT data at once (or faster than the song normally plays)
