# CST_426_Project
TODO:
1) Properly generate straight track mesh
2) Properly generate track mesh based on point array (point array comes from audio band data)
3) Fix/smoothe array data/stop it from curving: a) possibly voxels? or b) limit how fast it can rotate?
4) Process all audio data at once: a) get audioclip data and do Fourier transformation manually? or b) figure out how to correctly (and quickly) fast-forward an AudioSource to get all auto-FFT data at once (or faster than the song normally plays)
